## Machine Learning

[Classification Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_classification)

> In machine learning and statistics, classification is the problem of identifying to which of a set of categories (sub-populations) a new observation belongs, on the basis of a training set of data containing observations (or instances) whose category membership is known.
